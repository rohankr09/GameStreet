Game Street is a responsive web application that allows users to discover and explore trending video games using the RAWG API. This project was built following a tutorial, with additional customizations and improvements.
### Note: -
If the website doesn't load itself try refreshing there may be a chance of api being slow.
## Key Features
- Responsive Design: The website is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Trending Games: The application fetches and displays the latest trending games from the RAWG API, allowing users to stay up-to-date with the most popular titles.
- Game Details: Users can click on a game to view detailed information, including the game's rating, popularity and comments.
- Customized Footer: I've added a custom footer to the website, providing additional information or links as needed.
- Deployed on Vercel: I have successfully deployed the project on the Vercel platform, making it accessible to users worldwide.
